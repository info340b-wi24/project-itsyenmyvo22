        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>ARMY is the name of the BTS fandom. It's one of the biggest fandoms in the world and is known for being a passionate, active, and organized unit. They are a group of diverse individuals from around the world, consisting of people from different cultures, languages, and age demographics. Since their community is so large, there is an overwhelming amount of content that is produced. ARMY can get lost in the abundance of platforms, resources, and outlets disguised as catering to them. Finding the correct and up-to-date schedule information, sharing interests, and connecting with ARMYs is a difficult task with how dispersed everything is on the internet.</p>
        <p>The information technology problem within this space is that there is no centralized hub specifically tailored to ARMY that can allow for easy access to information, activities such as trading merchandise or game challenges, and creating a deeper connection within the community.</p>
        <p>Previous attempts to solve the problem of having a centralized hub include platforms such as <a href="https://weverse.io/" target="_blank">Weverse</a> or official social media platforms like <a href="https://twitter.com/?lang=en" target="_blank">Twitter</a> (X). As effective as these platforms are, they do not fully solve the problem that we are addressing. For example, Weverse is more catered towards purchasing merchandise and watching video content and falls flat when it comes to creating a connection within the community. Twitter (X) contains an overwhelming amount of information that is unorganized, making it difficult to find and filter the right information that someone needs. In addition, Twitter (X) can be a dangerous platform for younger audiences as the app does come with age restrictions that many users don't abide by.</p>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <h3>Users of Application</h3>
        <p>The users of this application are people part of the BTS ARMY. While this website is open to all BTS ARMY members, it specifically caters to younger BTS fans who may be unable to access Twitter (X) due to age restrictions. This app will try to support young fans who want to support BTS but cannot connect with members on Twitter (X). In addition, this website can help users in rural areas, who struggle to form a community and may not have the means to attend a BTS concert to find a community, so this website will foster connections. </p>
        <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
        <ul>

            </ul>
            <li>A trading feature</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Players upload their BTS trading card or BTS merchandise that they want to trade.</li>
                <li>They can search and filter the desired trading card/merchandise, and offer to trade.</li>

                <li>Users can add events they plan to attend to their personal calendars and set reminders of upcoming events.</li>
            </ul>

        </ul>
        <h3>Information Users Will View</h3>
        <p>Users of our app will be able to view/listen to snippets of songs from BTSâ€™s discography, specifically in the game feature. After playing the interactive guessing game, a score report along with the player's position on a public leaderboard will be displayed. Information on and links to video concerts, livestreams, and related media will be included on the site. Aesthetic profiles for each member of BTS will be featured on our web app, including images and associated text detailing their individual journeys, achievements, and personal interests. Users will have the ability to create and post their own trading cards which will then be made publicly available for viewing by all other users.</p>
        <h3>How the Web Application Solves the Problem</h3>
        <p>Using this app will help solve the problem of information overload within the BTS ARMY. Many members tweet events, but there is limited organization that can overwhelm users. The calendar feature solves this problem by providing an organized hub of events. In addition, this web application allows for a safe space to trade cards and play games. This means that children and younger BTS fans to connect and be a part of the BTS community, without having to rely on websites like Twitter, which is unsuitable for younger fans.</p>
