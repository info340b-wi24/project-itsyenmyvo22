        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>ARMY is the name of the BTS fandom. It's one of the biggest fandoms in the world and is known for being a passionate, active, and organized unit. They are a group of diverse individuals from around the world, consisting of people from different cultures, languages, and age demographics. Since their community is so large, there is an overwhelming amount of content that is produced. ARMY can get lost in the abundance of platforms, resources, and outlets disguised as catering to them. Finding the correct and up-to-date schedule information, sharing interests, and connecting with ARMYs is a difficult task with how dispersed everything is on the internet.</p>
        <p>The information technology problem within this space is that there is no centralized hub specifically tailored to ARMY that can allow for easy access to information, activities such as trading merchandise or game challenges, and creating a deeper connection within the community.</p>
        <p>Previous attempts to solve the problem of having a centralized hub include platforms such as <a href="https://weverse.io/" target="_blank">Weverse</a> or official social media platforms like <a href="https://twitter.com/?lang=en" target="_blank">Twitter</a> (X). As effective as these platforms are, they do not fully solve the problem that we are addressing. For example, Weverse is more catered towards purchasing merchandise and watching video content and falls flat when it comes to creating a connection within the community. Twitter (X) contains an overwhelming amount of information that is unorganized, making it difficult to find and filter the right information that someone needs. In addition, Twitter (X) can be a dangerous platform for younger audiences as the app does come with age restrictions that many users don't abide by.</p>
